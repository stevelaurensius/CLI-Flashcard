# Description
This individual project was submitted as part of my graded exam in a Python course, showcasing my skills as a software developer. It demonstrates my ability to handle command-line arguments, manage logs, and export data to external files.

Flashcards are a widely used method for learners to memorize Japanese characters, with each card featuring a character or phrase on one side and its definition on the other.

This project is inspired by my own journey of learning Japanese during my Bachelor's degree. Although the flashcard system is fully functional on its own, I envision evolving it into a mobile application. This future app will include additional features, such as a dictionary, to serve as a comprehensive companion for students. A fully customizable flashcard system empowers students to concentrate on the material that matters most. This project not only reflects my technical proficiency but also my passion for creating tools that enhance learning experiences.
